# Stanley's Journey

This is the tale of an unfortunate donkey named Stanley told by Alexa. Mostly just a fun way to explore the process of developing an alexa Skill. 

## In this repo: 
- index.py: The python code used as a lambda function as the backend for the alexa skill
- intent.json: The intent schema used to control the skill's flow
- sample_utterances.txt: Sentences users might say and how they map to the backend functions.
