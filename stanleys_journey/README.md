# Stanley's Journey
![](stanley.png?raw=true)

This is the tale of an unfortunate donkey named Stanley told by Alexa. Mostly just a fun way to explore the process of developing an alexa Skill. To try it out, use your Amazon app to install the skill on your echo. Then ask Alexa to "launch Stanley's Journey."

## In this repo: 
- index.py: The python code used as a lambda function as the backend for the alexa skill
- intent.json: The intent schema used to control the skill's flow
- sample_utterances.txt: Sentences users might say and how they map to the backend functions.
