Welcome: "We're about to embark on a magical journey. To get started, ask me to tell you about stanley. Or, if you already know about stanley, ask me to tell you about how stanley learned to navigate. If you get lost, just ask for help."
TheBeginning: "So, you want to know about Stanley, right? Well, he's quite the character. He was born in the high sierra to a strong donkey daddy, and a beautiful mother. They loved him very much, but unforntunately he wasn't very good at keeping up with the other pack mules. One day, while the family was out hauling water up to the mountain, Stanley fell behind and got lost. His family tried to look for him, but the mule driver said they had to keep pushing. His family was distraught. Isn't that sad? Do you want to know what happened next? If so, ask me what happened next?"
WhatHappenedNext: "Well, everyone thought he died that night. Eaten by a wolf or a bear. Stanley's parents were quite sad. But Stanley didn't die. In fact he was adopted by a mountain lion family and spent years training to be a vicious mountain lion. After several years, he was strong and mean. And most importantly, ready for revenge. Want to know more? Ask me how does it end."
HowDoesItEnd: "Well one day, Stanley came down from the lions den to seek revenge against the mean old Mule driver who separated him from his family. With blood on his mind, he entered the old stables. But when he saw his family, he remembered how much he loved them and forgot all about his blood feud. His family was so happy to see him, and they promised to teach him all about how to navigated. To hear about it, ask me to tell you how stanley learned to navigate."
Help: "Stanley's journey is confusing sometimes. A couple of examples of phrases that I can accept are... Tell me about stanley or, who is stanley. Lets get started now by trying one of these."

Lost_Beginning: "After such a terrifying episode, Stanley's parents decided he needed to learn about navigating the trail they used to resupply the people uphill. First they taught him that whenever they went out with the Mule Driver, he would take them along the stream until they reached the big wooden bridge. Stanley knew he could remember that, because of all the beautiful trout swimming in the steam. After crossing the bridge, they told Stanley to follow the trail until he got to the fork in the road where a big old pine tree shaded the trail. When he saw this pine tree, he needed to remember to stay on the side with the burn marks from the big fire. This was important to remember, because if he followed the trail on the other side, without the burn marks, he would end up going away from the stables. Stanley knew he would need to remember all of this, since he was going out with the Mule driver the next day. Want to hear more, asking me to tell you about the next day."
Lost_NextDay: "The next day, the mean old Mule Driver woke everyone up before dawn and told them to get a move on. By 5am they were marching up the mountain to deliver water to the people up the hill. Stanley did a great job keeping up, but on the way down the hill, he lost his footing and started to fall behind. At first, he could still see the dust from the other mules, But then he started to fall farther and farther behind. The old Mule driver cried out, Stanley No! But he didnâ€™t stop the mule train. After a while, he lost sight of the dust trail from the other mules, but he told him self he knew the way. Now, he just needed to follow the trail until he got to that big old tree. And then. Well. And then. He couldn't remember what to do next. When he gets to the fork, should Stanley stay on the side with the burn marks? Or should he follow the side without burn marks."
Lost_BurnMarks: " You're right, Stanley remembered he just needs to stay on the side of the tree with burn marks and then keep heading toward the bridge. And then when he gets to the bridge what does he do then? Head away from the stream? Or follow the stream."
Lost_NoBurnMarks: "Oh no, stanley followed your instructions and got lost! Say, tell me about the next day to try again and help teach Stanley to navigate."
Lost_Stream: "Yay! You got it. He just needs to follow the stream full of those beautiful trout all the way home to his parents. Good thing Stanley paid so much attention to the natural world around him! Looking forward to seeing you soon!"
Lost_NoStream: "Oh no, stanley followed your instructions and got lost! Say, follow the side with the burn marks to try again and help reunite Stanley with his family."
